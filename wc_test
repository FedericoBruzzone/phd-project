Conclusion
The proposed modular approach to implementing Language Servers via feature-oriented programming
within the Neverlang Language Workbench represents a significant advancement in reducing the complexity
and effort associated with developing Language Servers. By decomposing the LS functionality into reusable
and composable feature modules, this approach promises to enhance maintainability, extensibility, and overall
efficiency in the development of language support tools. Considering the potential impact of this research, I
am confident that the proposed project will yield valuable contributions to the field of programming language
development and integration, especially DSLs. By providing a modular framework for the implementation
of Language Servers, this research has the potential to improve the way language support tools are developed
and maintained. The reduction in development effort, the increased reusability of feature modules, and the
improved maintainability and extensibility of Language Servers are just a few of the benefits that this research
aims to deliver.
